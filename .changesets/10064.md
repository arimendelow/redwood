(Delete this help paragraph when you're done.) Thanks for writing a changeset! Here's a place to start.
Don't edit the title, but in editing the body, try to explain what this PR means for Redwood users.
The more detail the better. E.g., is it a new feature? How do they use it? Code examples go a long way!

- Add Storybook (Vite) framework package (#10064) by @arimendelow

# Overview
This PR is the first step to migrating our Storybook integration from relying on Webpack to relying on Vite. Specifically, this PR:
- Adds the [Storybook framework package](https://storybook.js.org/docs/contribute/framework) for RedwoodJS.
  - This follows the modern Storybook pattern for providing required configuration for getting Storybook to work with a given framework/metaframework.
  - For comparison, our current Webpack Storybook setup was written before framework packages were a thing, so its architected very differently. See the [@redwoodjs/testing](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/packages/testing) package for more information.
  - The eventual goal is for this package to move into the Storybook codebase and be "officially" supported.
  - This package was forked from the [`react-vite` framework package](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/react-vite).
- Adds the `storybook-vite` CLI package, which is based on the existing `storybook` CLI package. The CLI package does two important things before running the Storybook command:
  - Checks if the necessary project-side config files exist yet, and creates them if they don't.
  - Creates the Mock Service Worker, which is necessary for Cell mocking.

Importantly, the architecture of this (including duplicating files, etc.) is based on the eventual goal of removing the older Storybook integration files.

# Proof
This screen recording shows that the following works:

- [x] Router
- [x] Nested cells (waterfall)
- [x] Auth

# Details
This framework package is based on the proof of concept of getting Storybook working on RedwoodJS with Vite, which is documented [here](https://redwoodjs.notion.site/Shortest-Path-to-Storybook-Vite-A-Thought-Provoking-Guide-35a78e0f699445a1ae65e64eee43791a?pvs=25).

Please see that and official Storybook framework package documentation to understand implementation details.

# Outstanding
- The console outputs are a bit noisy, and it seems like it's just noise. Do we want to address/silence this?
- Testing?
- Cleanup?
- Finalize how we want to roll this out. For example:
  - Do we want to add a console message to the current CLI that it'll be removed in a future/next major?
  - How do we want to address the different CLI packages? Some options:
    - Temporarily keep the existing one as `yarn redwood storybook`, and make the new one `yarn redwood storybook-vite`.
    - Make the existing one `yarn redwood storybook-webpack`.
      - I'm concerned that folks will not be aware of this, causing friction.
- Based on the above, write migration guide.

# Trying it out

First step is, of course, pulling down this branch.

I've been testing this with the generated test project. If you want to do that, from the framework repo, first run:

`yarn run build:test-project ../for-testing-storybook-vite`

Then, over in your project, run `yarn rwfw project:tarsync` so that the module resolutions point to the ones in this branch.

Then, I think because it hasn't yet been published anywhere, you'll need to manually add the new CLI package (yarn complains about not being able to find the packument when I try to get the CLI package to autoinstall):
```sh
yarn add -D @redwoodjs/cli-storybook-vite@7
```

Then, run:
```sh
yarn rw sbv
```

Your browser should then open to Storybook!
